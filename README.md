# README File for Project 2 (Ann Lurie)

**Project URL:**  
[http://p2.annlurie.me/](http://p1.annlurie.me/)

**Project Description:**  
This project is a PHP application that generates a password 'phrase' made up of multiple dictionary words with optional definition of additional characters (a special character and/or 1- or 2-digit number) and formatting. The PHP logic relies on a pre-defined array of words with a key > value scheme in which the value indicates whether the word has been used to generate a password (to avoid re-use of a word from the array inside a password phrase).

The words are all kinds of monkeys.

**Demo Information:**  
I plan to demo this project in person during a section meeting.
